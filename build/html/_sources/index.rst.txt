Welcome to Giotto! 
===================================
A spatial single-cell transcriptomics toolbox
---------------------------------------------

The Giotto package consists of two modules, Giotto Analyzer and 
`Viewer <http://www.spatialgiotto.com>`_,
which provide tools to process, analyze and visualize
**single-cell spatial expression** data. The underlying
framework is generalizable to virtually all currently
available spatial datasets. We recently demonstrated the
general applicability on 10 different datasets created by 9
different state-of-the-art spatial technologies, including
*in situ* hybridization (seqFISH+, merFISH, osmFISH),
sequencing (Slide-seq, Visium, STARmap) and imaging-based
multiplexing/proteomics (CyCIF, MIBI, CODEX). These
technologies differ in terms of resolution (single cell vs
multiple cells), spatial dimension (2D vs 3D), molecular
modality (protein vs RNA), and throughput (number of cells
and genes). More information and documentation about the
latest **released version** of Giotto Analyzer can be found
at https://rubd.github.io/Giotto_site/.
